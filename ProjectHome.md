# Geoadminsuite (aka GAS) #
[GAS](http://sd-11986.dedibox.fr:8080/gas/) a distributed geodata manager and ExtJS/Openlayers-based site publisher

**Geoadminsuite** is an application developped using Java technologies (Non-distributed Java EE architecture).

The purpose is to administrate geographic data coming from heterogeneous sources
(local files, databases located on different servers).
The application is supported by standard Web browsers.

It is a free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.
This means you are free to use it and to modify it,
but if you distribute your modifications you must distribute the modified source code as well.

Geoadminsuite is an opensource project that was created in 2003 and developped into several versions up to now by **Gretti N'guessan** and **Nicolas Ribot**.

We hope you find this application useful for ... well, managing your data and maps, publishing websites or whatever it is able to do.
