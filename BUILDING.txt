Instructions for building the OpenJump database query plugin
------------------------------------------------------------

JDK 5.0 required
----------------
You need at least JDK 5.0 to build the plugin.

Get Ant
-------
An ant build.xml file is provided for you to build the plugin source.  If
you are a java developer, you most likely already have ant installed.  If 
not, get it at http://ant.apache.org.

Define OpenJUMP home
--------------------
Install OpenJump 1.2 or 1.3 if you don't already have it.  You might be able 
to tweak the ant build.xml if you want to build the code with a different
version of OpenJump.

For the build to work, you need to specify the directory that OpenJUMP
is installed in.  If you don't already have it, you can create a file called
build.properties in your home folder, and add a property called jump.home to
the build.properties file.  Alternatively, you can create a property file in
some other location and define jump.home in that property file, and use the 
ant "propertyfile" option to load it.  Finally, you can use the ant "D" 
option to specify a jump.home property.  However you do it, you need to tell
the build where OpenJump is installed.

Optionally install databases and JDBC drivers
---------------------------------------------
You don't need every database (or any database) installed to build the 
software. The code should compile and unit tests will run without
any databases. However, you will need some JDBC drivers to compile.
At a minimum you need to install the Oracle JDBC drivers (probably 
odjbc14.jar) and the PostgreSQL and PostGIS drivers in the dbdrivers
directory.

The Oracle drivers are available at
http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html.
You'll need an OTN account to download the drivers, but you can get one for
free from Oracle.  Read and accept the Oracle license, download ojdbc14.jar,
and place it in the source "dbdrivers" folder.

The Postgres JDBC driver is at http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html.  
Go there and download the appropriate JDBC driver for your version of
Postgres.  You'll also need the PostGIS JDBC driver.  Download postgis.jar 
from here: http://www.postgis.org/download/. Once you've downloaded them, 
place them in the "dbdrivers" folder.

If you don't have the MySQL JDBC drivers, you can get them from 
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html.  Download the
package, uncompress it, and copy the mysql-connector-java jar into the 
source "dbdrivers" folder.

For SpatiaLite, you just need the the SQLite JDBC driver, which  is here
http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/.

Useful Build Targets
--------------------
clean - cleans temporary build files
compile - compiles the source code
createjar - creates the plugin jar in dist/lib
deploy - deploys the plugin jar to the OpenJUMP plugin directory
package - creates the binary package in dist
packagesource - creates the source package in dist
