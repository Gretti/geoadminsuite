<h2>This package handles caching in the system.</h2>  

<p>
The main entry point is the ObjectCache.  However if finer control is required the examples
below can be used.  
</p>
<p>
The caching implementation is the whirlycache cache implementation. See <a href="http://https://whirlycache.dev.java.net/sample-whirlycache-xml-file.html">https://whirlycache.dev.java.net/sample-whirlycache-xml-file.html</a>
 for more details on it.  The main difference is that the Backing Cache that is used calls the 
 cacheable object (when the key is cacheable) when destroy or clear is called.  See
 DisposingCacheBackEnd for more details.    
 </p>
 The usage is basically:
 
 <pre>
	Datastore datastore;
	
	CacheManager cacheManager = CacheManager.getInstance();
	Cache cache = cacheManager.getCache();

	// internal key must be unique because it is what is used to 
	// implement equals() and hashcode()
	Cacheable key = new AbstractCacheable("internalKey"){
		private static final long serialVersionUID = -6838044912776739919L;

		public void onRemove(Object _value) {
			datastore.dispose();
		}
		
	};
	
	cache.store(key, datastore, 60000);

	// to retrieve 
	DataStore retrievedDatastore = (DataStore)cache.retrieve(key);
	
	cacheManager.destroy();	
 </pre>
 
 The keys are serializable so you can send them across threads.  Also any two AbstractCacheable
 objects with the same key can be used to retrieve the same Cached object.
